**BUP20: Sweet Pepper Dataset** is a dataset for instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, object detection, and monocular depth estimation tasks. It is used in the agricultural and robotics industries. 

The dataset consists of 560 images with 28830 labeled objects belonging to 5 different classes including *green*, *yellow*, *mixed yellow*, and other: *red* and *mixed red*.

Images in the BUP20 dataset have pixel-level instance segmentation and bounding box annotations. Due to the nature of the instance segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into a semantic segmentation task (only one mask for every class). All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are 3 splits in the dataset: *train* (248 images), *test* (186 images), and *val* (126 images). Alternatively, the dataset could be split into 5 rows: ***row4*** (126 images), ***row2*** (124 images), ***row3*** (124 images), ***row5*** (124 images), and ***row6*** (62 images), or into 2 dates: ***2020-10-01*** (310 images) and ***2020-09-24*** (250 images). Additionally, images are grouped by ***im id***. Also, every image marked with ***odometry*** tag, every image and label contain ***milliseconds*** tag. Every label contain infomation about its labeller: ***claus smitt***, ***ramsay***, ***chris mccool***, ***agr user1***, ***michallhal***. Explore it in supervisely labeling tool. The dataset was released in 2020 by the University of Bonn, Germany.
